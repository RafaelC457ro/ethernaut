# My Hardhat Project

This project is my learn environment to study how to hack Solidity smart contracts!

Things that I learned:

- storage layout (https://blockchain-academy.hs-mittweida.de/courses/solidity-coding-beginners-to-intermediate/lessons/solidity-12-reading-the-storage/topic/the-storage-layout/)
